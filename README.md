# PythonProject
_This was a school project using IDLE and Python_

We were tasked with choosing between Python or Ruby to replicate a previous homework assignment that we coded in C#. This project is suppose to be a managerial tool that provides the price of vegetables, shipping cost, and an end of day summary.

When you run the code you will be promoted to enter the number of vegetable in pounds. From there you can perform the following options:
* submit  
  ** yields produce price and shipping cost
* Summary  
  ** after submitting a couple of orders (pounds of produce) yields total produce price, average produce price, and a count of orders
* Reset  
  ** This will direct you back to the menu
* Exit  
  ** Exit Application
